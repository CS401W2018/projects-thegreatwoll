    <h1>Errol Jon Tan Rosaroso</h1>
    <p>My name is Errol Jon T. Rosaroso, a current student of Brigham Young University-Hawaii. I prefer to go by my nickname <abbr title="Errol Jon">EJ</abbr>. I major in Computer Science and minor in Film and Business Marketing. I have been in Hawaii for about 2 semesters now and I have loved both living and studying on the island. The dream I have is to be a software developer, film maker, and business owner.</p>
    <p>So far, in my professional career, I have had the chance to work as a video editor for various clients. My recent work experience has been working for a company called <em>Prepared Hero</em>. They sell fire safety products and outdoor gears. I was mainly responsible for creating direct response creatives and videos that they would use in their social media platforms to promote and sell their products.</p>
    <p>Currently, I work as the videographer and photographer for Seasider Sports, the sports department of the university. I have a goal of building enough experience and gain the skills that I need to make my craft better, which hopefully allows me to have greater opportunities in the future.</p>
    <p>Because of my love for computers and technology, I have been able to teach myself to work on softwares like:
        <ol type="A">
            <li>After Effects</li>
            <li>Premiere Pro</li>
            <li>Photoshop</li>
            <li>Illustrator</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>One of the things that has helped me accomplish the things that I have accomplished is the lesson that I got from a quote. The quote reads:</p>
    <blockquote>&quot;<i>The next best thing to being wise is to <mark>live in a circle of those who are.</mark></i>&quot;</blockquote>
    <h2>&ndash;C.S. Lewis</h2>
