            The Avengers is a movie created and produced by Marvel Studios that follows the adventures, action, and stories of a group of superheroes that banded together to fight off and stop an alien invasion on the planet Earth. The movie joined different superheroes from different franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It features Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and my favorite superhero, Spider-Man.

            I was around 4 years old when I first watched a superhero movie. That movie was Spider-Man, starring Tobey Maguire. Watching the scene where he first discovers that he has powers sparked a whole new world in my young mind. A world of superheroes. Growing up, I have grown fond of movies that depicted heroes with abilities that were out of this world. We have Superman, Batman, Wonderwoman, and many more. What really peaked my interest were the superheroes in the Marvel Universe, particularly those who were part of The Avengers. Seeing all my favorite superheroes band together to beat an enemy was the best thing to watch growing up. Since I got into the Marvel Universe, I have never missed one movie from individual franchises. I love the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They have made me love watching movies and have a creative view of what could be possible.

        <h2>Relative vs Absolute Link</h2>
        <p>
            A <dfn>Relative Link</dfn> is a link that is used in HTML for linking pages that are usually in the same website. We use relative links by using the anchor tag and putting in the file name or file path of the page that you want the link to direct to. 
            <br><br>
            An <dfn>Absolute Link</dfn> is a link that is used in HTML for linking pages that directs to an external web page or website. We use an absolute link by using the same anchor tag and directly copy the URL of the external website that we want the link to direct to.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is an example of a relative link: <a href="../ejtrprofilepage.html">Profile Page</a>
            <br><br>
            This is an example of an absolute link: <a href="https://www.marvel.com/teams-and-groups/avengers">Marvel's Avengers</a>
