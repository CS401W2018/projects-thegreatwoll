                This website is a collection of my best works working as a creative for both video production and photography. My goal is to build a consistent, unique, and established creative workflow that will benefit multiple organizations when it comes to their creative needs. I have had about 3 years of experience working as a video editor and did a little bit of work on graphic design. I am a hard working and creative individual with a keen eye to details and precision.
