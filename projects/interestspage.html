            I was around 4 years old when I first watched a superhero movie. That movie was Spider-Man, starring Tobey Maguire. Watching the scene where he first discovers that he has powers sparked a whole new world in my young mind. A world of superheroes. Growing up, I have grown fond of movies that depicted heroes with abilities that were out of this world. We have Superman, Batman, Wonderwoman, and many more. What really peaked my interest were the superheroes in the Marvel Universe, particularly those who were part of The Avengers.
