            What are the positives and negatives of hosting your videos on YouTube?
        </p>
        <p>
            The good thing about hosting our videos on YouTube is that it is free since YouTube allows us to embed videos uploaded to the platform on our webpages. The bad thing is that if we are a business, and we embed videos from YouTube, it might show content from our competitors, especially ads, which can disrupt the objective of the business.

            What is the most useful thing you can do with a transform?
        </p>
        <p>
            The most useful thing we can do with transform is rotating elements in our webpage.

            How do you stay safe online?
        </p>
        <p>
            To stay safe online, we need to integrate some kind of encryption in our websites or those that we visit to. We can do so by making sure we are using sa secure protocol such as HTTPS which allows the client to connect to a server in a secure way.

            What is the schedule for the rest of the class?
