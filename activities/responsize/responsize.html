            Why is the viewport meta tag important?
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important because it contains important information and configuration about how devices, especially mobiles, would act when viewing the webpage in different sizes.

            How can you adjust the CSS for printing?
        </p>
        <p>
            To adjust the CSS for printing, we can make a copy of the CSS and link it as print media in the HTML. In the print CSS, we can remove unnecessary objects to be excluded from printing and modify colors and fonts that best suit the print.
        </p>
        <p class="que">
            When would you want to adjust the CSS for printing?
        </p>
        <p>
            You would want to adjust the CSS for printing if you want to ensure that the webpage will be formatted and displayed properly when set to a document to be printed. We want to make sure that the displays and elements are clear and visible when printed.

            When you select the same tag twice, and in one of them you say "flex-direction: column;" and the other says "flex-direction: row;", which one takes priority?
        </p>
        <p>
            The latest input is the one that takes priority. In this case, the "flex-direction: row;" is the one that takes priority.

            How do you change the CSS for a web page displayed on a phone?
        </p>
        <p>
            We can change the CSS for a web page by using the @media ONLY screen function in the CSS and placing it at the bottom and specifying the max width that we want it to have it take effect on our web page.
