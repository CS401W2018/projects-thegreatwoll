            Flex and CSS
        </p>
        <p>
            For today's class, I learned how CSS Flex works. It's mainly a one dimensional customization tool that works when moving different elements in a webpage. What's good about it is that it is flexible, meaning it adjusts naturally relative to the size of the webpage or window you are viewing it on. That makes it really handy when creating webpages that are viewed in various devices with different sizes.

            Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from it being a requirement by the government to websites that can be accessed by the public, it is also a big help to those who have disabilities. An accessible website means that it can provide the same content that normal people can access to those who have disabilities like blindness, deaf, amputees, and others. This promotes inclusivity throughout the internet.
