            What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?
        </p>
        <p>
            Block Tags form a box and creates a line break and occupies 100% of the width. The height only depends on the content of the tag.
            Inline Tags are tags that does not cause line breaks. They are used within the lines to group certain elements and allow for selecting specific parts to modify through CSS. Sizes cannot be adjusted and cannot be moved.

            What is the margin, border, and padding?
        </p>
        <p>
            Margin is the space outside the box model. The border is the outline of the box that surrounds the element in the web page. Lastly, the padding is the space from the border going inwards the box model.
