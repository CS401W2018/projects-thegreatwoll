            <h2>Engagement Activity</h2>
            <p class="que">The form tag has an "action" attribute. What does it do?</p>
            <p>
                The action attribute contains the source or the link to the page that we want to load once we submit the form that the user fills up on our page.
            </p>
            <p class="que">The form tag has a "method" attribute. What does it do?</p>
            <p>
                The method attribute allows us to select whether the form in our webpage will follow a get request or a post request when processing the data.
            </p>
            <p class="que">What is the difference between a "POST" and a "GET"?</p>
            <p>
                We use a POST request when we want to change information or data in the server with the use of the forms we have set up in our webpage. A GET request is used when all that we want to do is to read data, for example in a search engine, which allows us to share the specific data we requested to others.
            </p>
            <h2>Part 2</h2>
            <p class="que">What are different ways to style your form?</p>
            <p>
                There are different ways for us to style forms in our webpages. We can use CSS Grid, Float, or Flex among others.
            </p>
            <p class="que">Why does the professor like to use flex?</p>
            <p>
                The professor likes to use Flex because it is a lot more convenient when we are trying to make things fit or work when we switch devices. With a little to few adjustments, we can create forms that can work in multiple devices.
            </p>
            <h2>Part 3</h2>
            <p class="que">What is JavaScript? How did it get its name?</p>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a programming language used in developing web pages together with CSS and HTML that adds other functions or interactivity. It was developed by Sun Microsystems which owned Java and they wanted to be known as the web company so they named the programming language JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p class="que">What are the two ways you can run JavaScript?</p>
            <p>
                The first way to run JavaScript is by the DOM or Document Object Model which runs in the context of a webpage. The second way is through Node.js
            </p>
            <p class="que">What was the most popular front-end js library?</p>
            <p>
                Before, the most popular front-end js library was jQuery.
            </p>
            <p class="que">What is the most popular front-end js library today?</p>
            <p>
                Currently, the most popular js library is React.js.
            </p>
            <h2>Part 4</h2>
            <p class="que">What is AJAX?</p>
            <p>
                AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML which allows the page to not need to reload once the form is submitted but make changes in the page through JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p class="que">Why do you put your JS Code in a separate file?</p>
            <p>
                Much like how we put CSS on a different file, we want to put our JS code in a separate file so we can reuse it in other pages within our web page. It also makes it easier for those working specifically on HTML separate from those working on the code or JavaScript.
