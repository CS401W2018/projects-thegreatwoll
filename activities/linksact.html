            <strong>Difference between Absolute and Relative Links</strong>
            <blockquote>
                Absolute links are links that we put into the html direcly from the website that we are trying to link to. We copy and past the URL of the website we want the link to direct to. It is usually used to link to a different website or domain.
                <br><br>
                Relative links are links we use to link within our website and does not need to be updated when the domain of our pages that we want to direct to changes.

            <strong>Do links need to be inside a NAV tag?</strong>
            <blockquote>
                No. Links do not always have to be in the NAV tag. It can be in the main body, header, and footer as well.
