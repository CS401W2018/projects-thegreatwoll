    <main>
        <h2>Title and Topic:</h2>
        <h2>SoleSleekR</h2>
        <h3>All about sneaker trends and lifestyle</h3>
        <p>In one of my business class, we are pitching a business proposal about a shoe cleaning service for our final project this semester. I chose this topic for my final web design project because I want to get the experience of building something that may actually be useful for business, even if it's just in a hypothetical way. I would also love to see the challenges that I will be facing while making this project.</p>
        <h2>Contents:</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Collection and what SoleSleekR is about</li>
        <li>Products/Services offered</li>
        <li>Sneaker Care and News</li>
        <li>About the Founders and Contact Information</li>
        <li>Pricelist</li>
        <li>Service Registration/Request Form</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Table and Form</h2>
        <p>My table will contain the list of services and products our business will offer, what goes with it, and will include the prices for each product and service</p>
        <p>The form in my web page will inlcude a service request and order form where I will be asking what service or product they are wanting to avail, their personal and contact information, and address for delivery purposes.</p>
        <h2>Images and Content</h2>
        <p>For images and contents for my site, I will be using generative AI to generate some photos or illustrations to include in my webpage. I will also be using creative common elements to be found online and royalty free photos.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AI Generated Art for logos</li>
            <li>Creative Common Images from Wikipedia</li>
            <li>Original Content from our Business Pitch</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Link to some sources I am planning on getting contents for my website are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.complex.com/sneakers">Complex Sneakers</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://sneakernews.com/">Sneaker News</a></li>
