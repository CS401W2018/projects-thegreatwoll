                    First called as "Plimsoll" in the 1870s and worn by vacationers and later by tennis and croquet players, plimsolls were known for it's comfort in the court. Becuase of its unique style and engraved patterns in the sole, it was very good in handling the grip of the user when in contact with the floor. Both for physical activities, leisure, and casual wear, this emerging style of shoes became one of a kind that even the British Army ordered a bulk of them.

                    Later on in the early 20th century, plimsolls became big in the Americas where it was called, you guessed that right, "sneakers". From tennis courts to basketball courts, sneakers was popularized by basketball players in the NBA with basketball star Chuck Taylor promoting Converse All Stars signature sneaker, Chuck Taylors. All of these success in the sports industry was attributed to the invention of rubber-soled shoes in the US which became a standard for what sneakers are today.
