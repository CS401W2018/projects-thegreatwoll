            <p>A group of sneaker enthusiasts trying to make a mark in this world. Led by me, Errol Jon "EJ" Rosaroso, our hope and dream is to be able to make this world a better and slicker place one footwear at a time. Growing up, I have always loved getting new shoes. From my squeeky shoes and sandals in my toddler phase, to my velcro-strapped shoes in elementary, and to my first ever Air Jordan in High School, I have loved receiving and collecting footwear. A huge influence to me has been my brother who has been a sneakerhead himself. I was inspired to make this platform to build a place where people can unite, share stories, experiences, as well as offer and request services for our daily footwear needs. Let this be a beginning of something great. A place of refuge for all you sneakerheads out there!</p>
